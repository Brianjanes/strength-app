busy day today - tenant moved out of house, getting ready to sell! some boilerplate stuff added.

# 22/09

worked on the sidebar component mostly - took me a little while to figure out the CSS for making it span 100% height. It ended up being position: abdolute; in the sidebar-main component. This has laid the groundwork for the routes, and I also brought in BrowserRouter to help architect the layout for the main app component.
